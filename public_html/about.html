<h2>I'm a freelancer living in Madrid, Spain. My favorite kinds of clients are small teams still in their early stages. I like finding creative solutions to difficult problems. Sometimes that means developing software, but not always. It is often smarter to "program" your team correctly before starting to write software. In other words, a good plan is better than a good app. As a native English and Spanish speaker, I also do language based work such as translating, teaching, and proofreading.</h2>
